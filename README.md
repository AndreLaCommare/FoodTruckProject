# FoodTruck Application


# Description
	The purpose of this project was to create an array of Foodtruck objects that all possessed certain unique variables, some input by the user, and some assigned by the program. The user will have the option to enter up to 5 food trucks as well as enter the food type they serve and the rating they would give the Foodtruck. The user will then be given the option to display each individual truck, average their scores, or display the truck object that possessed the highest score. The user is not required to enter all five trucks and the program will respond and display accordingly, ignoring null values. The user will be prompted with options in relation to the Foodtruck Array until the user decides to quit the application.
# Technologies Used
	Java, Eclipse, Skill Distillery TAs
# Lessons Learned
	This project helped solidify the requirements around calling non static methods. It was also a great introduction into the nuances of constructors and creating them to take in parameters in order for private variables to be defined. This project also helped reiterate the functionality behind packages and classes for me. I feel I am starting to understand how the Foodtruck class and the FoodtruckApp class communicate with each other. A great way to start but I can tell there's a lot to go.
